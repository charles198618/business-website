        <p> A limited warranty is not only beneficial but essential when a full warranty isn't an option.
          <br>
          Along with our trusted home inspection partners, we want to provide you with additional protection and peace
          of mind
          during the home buying process. With our Limited Home Warranty, you get that and more. It costs you nothing
          and proves
          that your home inspector has your best interests in mind. They are working for you, not the sellers!
        </p>

        <h1>WHAT IS A LIMITED WARRANTY?</h1>

        <p>AHWC provides limited warranties. These warranties are not meant to replace full coverage warranties. Instead, they
          are meant to provide coverage for certain components within a home's foundation. The value of our warranty is seen
          when an inspector might have missed an issue during inspection.
          <br>
          Our warranty has no service contract or cost to the homeowner. We are able to lend a hand to the homeowner by selling a
          low cost warranty to inspectors, which does include a maximum payout limit.
        </p>

        <h1>HOW DO YOU PURCHASE A WARRANTY?</h1>

        <p><a href="">Contact</a>us to help find an inspector who carries our limited home warranty in your area!
          <br>
          The process is simple. To receive a Limited Home Warranty, prior to your home inspection, confirm the home inspector
          you have chosen carries our warranty in addition to the services they provide. You don't have to do anything else. You
          will receive your limited home warranty shortly after the completed home inspection, either by email or directly from
          American Home Warranty Company. There is no payment necessary for you as a homeowner.
          <br>
          Don't complete the home buying process without us.
