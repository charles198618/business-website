        <p>We have developed and maintained our Inspector Program to make it easy for you to run your business and
          provide
          your clients with our warranties for almost 20 years.</p>
        <h1>PROGRAM OVERVIEW</h1>

        <p>Many new homeowners say they prefer a limited home warranty to be included in their home inspection. That's
          why our limited home warranty is such an incredible benefit. <br>
          We add value to the home inspection process while also providing peace of mind for you and your clients.
          <br>
          <br>
          By becoming a member of our Inspector Program, you are setting your business up for long term success and
          customer satisfaction. We handle all the hard work, all you need <br>
          to do is provide us with your after-inspection paper and our team will take it from there. No stress or
          hassle, we do the work for you!
          <br>
          Don't miss out on this opportunity, join American Home Warranty Company today!
        </p>

        <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>

        <p>Are you interested in becoming a member of our Inspector Program? If so, the process is easy.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Our limited home warranty complements, rather than competes, with traditional long-term warranties></li>
          <li>The 90 day limited warranty provides coverage for mechanical and structural problems that were missed
            in the inspection report, or that may occur during the coverage period</li>
          <li>Our claimants are responsible for finding their own licensed technicians to repair or replace the failing
            system or component.
            This is beneficial because homeowners can
            choose the professionals that best serve their needs.</li>
          <li>Referring agents can show that they have their clients' best interests in mind by recommending a
            professional inspector who
            offers free limited warranty coverage with
            every inspection he performs</li>
        </ul>

        <p> You don't have to worry about the details of warranty coverage. When you present your clients with the
          inspection
          report and limited warranty, you will direct them to our detailed <br> one page warranty forum.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the event an issue arises, they contact us to file a claim. Our staff will work with the clients and keep
          you
          informed throughout the process. Should we need information from you, <br> we'll reach out as necessary.
          Otherwise,
          you can
          go about business as usual.
          <br>
          <br>
          Major credit cards are accepted for payment. Additional information about fee amounts and plans, limited
          warranty
          forms, available marketing support materials, etc, is available at <br> custserv@ahomewarranty.com or
          1-800-404-5479.
        </p>

        <h1>BENEFITS TO THE INSPECTOR</h1>

        <p><strong>An affordable addition to your package of professional services:</strong> By providing limited
          warranties as an
          additional
          service to your customers, you are putting your business above the <br> competition. You offer something the
          majority of
          other home inspectors don't and that is additional peace of mind to homeowners.
