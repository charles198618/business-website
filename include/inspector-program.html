        <p>We have developed and maintained our Inspector Program to make it easy for you to run your business and
          provide
          your clients with our warranties for almost 20 years.</p>
        <h1>PROGRAM OVERVIEW</h1>

        <p>Many new homeowners say they prefer a limited home warranty to be included in their home inspection. That's
          why our limited home warranty is such an incredible benefit. <br>
          We add value to the home inspection process while also providing peace of mind for you and your clients.
          <br>
          <br>
          By becoming a member of our Inspector Program, you are setting your business up for long term success and
          customer satisfaction. We handle all the hard work, all you need <br>
          to do is provide us with your after-inspection paper and our team will take it from there. No stress or
          hassle, we do the work for you!
          <br>
          Don't miss out on this opportunity, join American Home Warranty Company today!
        </p>

        <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>

        <p>Are you interested in becoming a member of our Inspector Program? If so, the process is easy.</p>

        <ol>
          <li><a href="">sign up online</a></li>
          <li>Log into your inspector portal to submit warranty information and payment whenever you do a home
            inspection.</li>
          <li> All done - it's that easy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p> You don't have to worry about the details of warranty coverage. When you present your clients with the
          inspection
          report and limited warranty, you will direct them to our detailed <br> one page warranty forum.
          <br>
          <br>
          In the event an issue arises, they contact us to file a claim. Our staff will work with the clients and keep
          you
          informed throughout the process. Should we need information from you, <br> we'll reach out as necessary.
          Otherwise,
          you can
          go about business as usual.
          <br>
          <br>
          Major credit cards are accepted for payment. Additional information about fee amounts and plans, limited
          warranty
          forms, available marketing support materials, etc, is available at <br> custserv@ahomewarranty.com or
          1-800-404-5479.
        </p>

        <h1>BENEFITS TO THE INSPECTOR</h1>

        <p><strong>An affordable addition to your package of professional services:</strong> By providing limited
          warranties as an
          additional
          service to your customers, you are putting your business above the <br> competition. You offer something the
          majority of
          other home inspectors don't and that is additional peace of mind to homeowners.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong>Enhanced value for your clients:</strong> Customers will value your business more if you provide them
          with a limited
          warranty
          that includes mechanical and structural coverage. They will see <br> that you have their best interest in mind
          and
          want
          them to feel supported if something goes wrong in their new home.
          <br>
          <br>
          <strong> Coverage if something goes wrong:</strong>It happens - sometimes people move into their homes and
          issues arise. You
          don't want
          that to fall back into your hands, so we take care of it for you. <br> If you include our 90 day limited
          warranty
          with your
          home inspection report, we take care of the claims process from start to finish. We will communicate with the
          homeowner and only <br> involve you if additional information is necessary. You'll be able to focus on
          business
          while we
          take care of our clients.
        </p>
